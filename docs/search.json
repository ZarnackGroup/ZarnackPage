    "text": "Research Topics\n\nClinical Topics\n\nDepression – We are interested in improving the assessment and treatment of depression. In particular, we are interested in (a) developing computational depression screening tools that can be deployed in under-served (e.g., remote or low resource) communities, (b) studying the connections between mood, depression, and interpersonal functioning, and (c) understanding the psychotherapeutic processes that contribute to recovery from depression.\nPosttraumatic Stress Disorder – We are interested in how individuals who survive traumatic events respond to, make sense of, and communicate about their experiences. Toward this end, we collect and analyze trauma narratives and impact statements from patients seeking treatment for PTSD and from community members who experienced traumatic events but did not develop PTSD. We are using observational methods to measure and analyze the patterns of behaviors, emotions, and cognitions evident in these narratives and statements. Our goals are to improve PTSD assessment and to deepen clinical understanding of the psychological processes that contribute to the development, maintenance, and recovery from PTSD.\nClinical decision-making – We are interested in developing tools to support the clinical decision-making of mental healthcare workers such as (a) determining the optimal time to discharge psychiatric inpatients from the hospital, and (b) estimating patients’ risk of dropping out of psychotherapy early. This topic is deeply connected to the methodology of predictive machine learning (see below).\nStructure of psychopathology – We are interested in advancing scientific knowledge about the ways in which psychiatric signs and symptoms organize into transdiagnostic dimensions or “spectra.” As part of this effort, we are working on creating an R package for the “Bass-Ackwards” factor analytical technique (Goldberg, 2006; Forbes, 2020). We are also interested in disentangling measures of dysfunction and traits/symptoms.\nBehavioral synchrony – We are interested in studying the emergence of behavioral synchronization between members of interacting dyads (e.g., therapists and patients or parents and children). We are applying this to studying the development of the working alliance (i.e., therapeutic relationship) during psychotherapy for depression and the communication dynamics between parents and children at high risk of suicide. As part of this effort, we are working on creating an R package for the windowed cross-correlation technique for quantifying behavioral synchrony (Boker et al., 2002).\n\n\n\nMethodological Topics\n\nInterrater reliability statistics – We are interested in developing statistical techniques that quantify the degree of reliability (e.g., agreement or consistency) between raters in observational and judgment studies. As part of this effort, we are working on finalizing the agreement R package for chance-adjusted indexes of categorical agreement and are working on integrating insights and tools from Bayesian statistics and generalizability theory in the varde R pacakge.\nCircumplex statistics – We are interested in developing statistical techniques that leverage the circular structure of circumplex models of affect and interpersonal functioning. As part of this effort, we are working on expanding the circumplex R package with additional functionality and developing new extensions of the Structural Summary Method (Gurtman, 1992; Zimmermann & Wright, 2017) that accommodate multilevel (e.g., clustered and longitudinal) data and latent variables.\nObservational methods – We are interested in measuring behavior as it actually occurs using human and algorithmic observers. Toward this end, we are working on creating databases of observational records (e.g., videos) to share with other researchers and are developing software and educational resources to aid in the collection and analysis of observational data.\nApplied machine learning – We are interested in applying recent advances in predictive modeling techniques to the study of human behavior (e.g., to aid in clinical decision-making and observational measurement). We are particularly interested in model evaluation, explanation, and comparison techniques that combine insights and techniques from statistical inference and machine learning.\nBayesian multilevel modeling – We are interested in leveraging the wonderful flexibility of Bayesian mixed effects models to answer applied questions about multilevel (e.g., clustered or longitudinal) data. We are also interested in adapting this framework to improve estimation in other topics (e.g., inter-rater reliability statistics, circumplex statistics, and comparing machine learning models)."

    "text": "Hypoxia induces massive changes in alternative splicing (AS) to adapt cells to the lack of oxygen. In this project SRSF6 was found to be a key factor in the AS response to hypoxia. A strong reduction in SRSF6 levels in acute hypoxia led to exon skipping and triggered nuclear speckle dispersal as a mechanism for the cell to reprogram the gene expression profile. We found this mechanism to be active in various cancer types and further propose a tumor suppressor function.\nThe full manuscript can be found at Nucleic Acids Research."

In this project we characterized the SRSF6 binding landscape in human pancreatic β-cells and identified a purine-rich SRSF6 consensus motif. We also observed, that the positioning of SRSF6 determined the splicing fate by either promoting exon skipping or exon inclusion. Our results also show that such splicing changes can be modulated by the use of antisense oligonucleotides.\nThe full manuscript can be found at Life Science Alliance."

    "text": "Translating ribosomes that encounter poly(A) sequences are terminally stalled, as quality control mechanism, followed by ribosome recycling and decay of the truncated nascent polypeptide via ribosome-associated quality control. In this project we demonstrated that the conserved RNA-binding E3 ubiquitin ligase Makorin Ring Finger Protein 1 (MKRN1) promotes ribosome stalling at poly(A) sequences during ribosome-associated quality control. We observed a direct interaction with the cytoplasmic poly(A)-binding protein (PABPC1) as well as precice position upstream of poly(A) tails in the mRNA.Thus we propose that MKRN1 mediates the recognition of poly(A) tails to prevent the production of erroneous proteins from prematurely polyadenylated transcripts, thereby maintaining proteome integrity.\nThe full manuscript can be found at Genome Biology."

    "text": "In pancreatic β-cells SRSF6 down-regulation promotes β-cell demise through splicing dysregulation of central genes for β-cells function and survival. In this project we characterized the SRSF6 binding landscape in human pancreatic β-cells and identified a purine-rich SRSF6 consensus motif. We also observed, that the positioning of SRSF6 determined the splicing fate by either promoting exon skipping or exon inclusion. Our results also show that such splicing changes can be modulated by the use of antisense oligonucleotides.\nThe full manuscript can be found at Life Science Alliance."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Hypoxia induces massive changes in alternative splicing (AS) to adapt cells to the lack of oxygen. In this project SRSF6 was found to be a key factor in the AS response to hypoxia. A strong reduction in SRSF6 levels in acute hypoxia led to exon skipping and triggered nuclear speckle dispersal as a mechanism for the cell to reprogram the gene expression profile. We found this mechanism to be active in various cancer types and further propose a tumor suppressor function.\nThe full manuscript can be found at Nucleic Acids Research."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The activation and differentiation of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) are involved in tumor progression. Here, we showed that the tumor-promoting lipid mediator prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) plays a paradoxical role in CAF activation and tumor progression. The inflammatory lipid prostaglandin E2 suppresses cancer-associated fibroblast expansion and activation limited primary mammary tumor growth while promoting metastasis. These data characterized in this project suggests a new pathway of regulating inflammatory CAF activation, which affects breast cancer progression.\nThe full manuscript can be found at Cancer Research."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Translating ribosomes that encounter poly(A) sequences are terminally stalled, as quality control mechanism, followed by ribosome recycling and decay of the truncated nascent polypeptide via ribosome-associated quality control. In this project we demonstrated that the conserved RNA-binding E3 ubiquitin ligase Makorin Ring Finger Protein 1 (MKRN1) promotes ribosome stalling at poly(A) sequences during ribosome-associated quality control. We observed a direct interaction with the cytoplasmic poly(A)-binding protein (PABPC1) as well as precice position upstream of poly(A) tails in the mRNA.Thus we propose that MKRN1 mediates the recognition of poly(A) tails to prevent the production of erroneous proteins from prematurely polyadenylated transcripts, thereby maintaining proteome integrity.\nThe full manuscript can be found at Genome Biology."

This information can be obtained from individual-nucleotide resolution UV crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (iCLIP) experiments. In this project we discribed the complete bioinformatic data analysis workflow to reliably detect RBP binding sites from iCLIP data. The workflow covers all steps from the initial quality control of the sequencing reads up to peak calling and quantification of RBP binding. For each tool, we explain the specific requirements for iCLIP data analysis and suggest optimized parameter settings.\nThe full manuscript can be found at Methods and an updated version of the binding site definition part is published as the R/ Bioconductor packge BindingSiteFinder Bioconductor page."
